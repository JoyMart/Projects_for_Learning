	<p> I work on coding practie for about 5 hours a day, typically from <time> 10:00</time> to <time> 18:00</time> with an hour break in that overall time. 
	</p>
	<p> I tend to only work 3 hours and my hands will get really exhausted. I am not used to typing this much. Even in college when I write papers, my hands rarely get cramped!
		That is not the case with coding. There are new keys I do not typically use that I have to use dozens of times!
