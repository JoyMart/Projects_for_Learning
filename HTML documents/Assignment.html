			<h3> I love plants,</h3>
		and though I don't physically hug them, I do want to show them that I love them. Nature deserves our respect and apreciation. We cannot survive without the necessary cycles the world goes through each year. 
		</p>
		<p> Here is a quote from an article published by Reuters, entitled "Does it pay to protect nature? A new study weighs in."
			<blockquote 
			cite= "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-biodiversity-idUSKBN2491ZW">
			A 30% conservation goal, aside from producing natural resources like fish stocks and timber, would also help to guarantee healthy ecosystems that provide an additional $350 billion a year in services that are essential to life, including filtering water, clearing air pollutants or preventing coastal erosion, the report said.
			...But first, countries have to join the effort. And even then, compliance is not guaranteed. Despite having more than 190 countries pledge to fight climate change under the 2015 Paris Agreement, emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to rise.
